In a recent project, I aimed to enhance a chatbot's conversational abilities by modifying its text file. This involved integrating several topics such as travel, sports, personal stories, hobbies, futuristic speculations, and health and wellness. My goal was to make the chatbot capable of comprehending and engaging with users on these diverse subjects. While I successfully added these topics to the chatbot's knowledge base, I encountered a significant hurdle. When I tried to continue the conversation after the chatbot's initial responses, it often struggled to provide meaningful follow-up responses, posing a challenge in maintaining engaging and coherent dialogues with users.
