Medical Expert System in Prolog

In my university course, I had the opportunity to explore the world of AI through a practical implementation. I developed a simple expert system in Prolog, which serves as a tool for medical diagnosis.

This project enhanced my understanding of logical reasoning and how AI systems make inferences based on rules. I also learned the importance of designing user-friendly interfaces for AI applications to facilitate user input and understanding.

The expert system is designed to assist in the diagnosis of various medical conditions based on user-provided symptoms. It uses a rule-based approach, where each disease is associated with a set of symptoms, and the system makes a diagnosis by matching the user's symptoms with these rules.

In this project I used online documentation to see how exactly the language Prolog works, and with that I was able then to modify the prolog code given
and add the diseases with their symptoms that I got online, and to that I installed an editor named Atom which is good for prolog syntax.
So I was able to successfully implement the expert system using Prolog facts and rules. The system interacts with users through a text-based interface, asking questions and providing diagnoses. I used dynamic predicates in Prolog to handle user responses and maintain information throughout the consultation.

This project was a valuable learning experience that gave me first-hand insights into the development and application of AI systems. It also showed me the potential of AI to revolutionize the healthcare industry.
