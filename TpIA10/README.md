In this exploration of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) using the sklearn-som package, we navigated through the process of initializing, loading data, creating and training SOM models, and visualizing the results. Beginning with the installation of the necessary package and importing relevant libraries, we loaded the wine dataset, trained the SOM model, and projected data onto a two-dimensional grid. Visualization played a key role, showcasing clusters after one epoch and experimenting with different numbers of epochs. Jitter techniques were employed for better point distinction. An alternative visualization technique using distance transformations was also explored. The journey concluded with the display of compelling visualizations, offering insights into the SOM's ability to reveal patterns and structures in the wine dataset.
Additionally, this SOM exploration builds upon concepts from Tutorial (TD) 8, leveraging the wine dataset to further enhance our understanding of Self-Organizing Maps and their application in analyzing complex data structures.
